# Django Training - 4. Class-based Views, User class, Authentication

## Grade 90/100



* **(-10) your model create views return the following error: `No URL to redirect to.  Either provide a url or define a get_absolute_url method on the Model`. You didn't provide a success URL. Make sure you test all your changes before pushing them to the repository.**
* **Media directories are part of the server storage, not the code base, therefore they shouldn't be pushed to the repository, add your media directory to .gitignore and make sure your repository doesn't include any uploaded media files.**
